            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>rote them, and the testimonies before alleadged, of Catholicks and Proteſtants, in commendation of the author, be of far more waight to iuſtify his relation, then the light and vaine ſuſpition of any, to call the booke in question.

Nay to free vs from all feare of any ſuſpition, him ſelfe was ſo carefull of truth, that being about to write this booke, of the miraculous lines and deathes of Italian Saints, inuited thereunto by the vertuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his familiar friends, he directed his letters to others, for certaine information the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein: as namely to <hi>Maximinianus,</hi> Bishope of <hi>Syracuſis</hi> in <hi>Sicilie:</hi> to whom he wrotte tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter, in theſe very wordes. <hi>My</hi>

               <hi>brethren that liue familiarly with me, do enforce me by all meanes, briefly to commit vnto writing, ſome miracles of thoſe fathers, which we haue heard
<pb facs="tcp:21746:16"/> done in Italy. For the effecting wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I ſtande in very great nede of your charitable aſſiſtance: to witt, that you woulde ſignify vnto me ſuch things, as come to your memory, or it hath bene your chance to knowe. For I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <note place="margin">See lib. 1. cap 7.</note> well, that you tolde me ſome thinges, concerning Abbot Nonnoſus, who liued nere vnto Anaſtaſius of Pentumis, which I haue quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Wherefore I deſire you, to write vnto me both that, and whatſoeuer els you knowe of like quality, and ſpedily to ſende them, vnleſſe you determine to be here ſhortly your ſelfe in perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the great care, and ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, which he vſed in this heauenly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines: by reaſon whereof, he was the better able to performe that thinge, which abundantly he hath done, and that is, diligently to ſett downe howe, and by what meanes, he came to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities, of whatſoeuer in his <hi>Dialogues</hi> he reporteth: a greater thinge then which, to giue credit to his writinges, none can be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and therefore thoſE that will doubtfully deſcant of his stories; will hardly euer beleeue any, further then shall pleaſe their owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor: for a more certayne, and ſure courſe can not be deuiſed: neither do I remember, the like
<pb facs="tcp:21746:17"/> to haue bene ſo obſerued of any other auncient histriographers whatſoeuer. And ſurely, thoſe which be ſo captious, as to controll what fitteth not their fancy, woulde I make no doubte, as liberally ſpeake their pleaſure, (as in truth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in like caſes haue) and deliuer their quicke cenſure, againſt many ſtories, no leſſe ſtrange then any reported by <hi>S.

Tell this ſtory, I ſay, to many Proteſtantes, that knowe not with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb facs="tcp:21746:18"/> authority it is backed, and a man had nede of a broade backe, to bare the frumppes and ſcoffes which they will loade vpon him, for giuing credit to ſuch an olde wiues tale: and yet in fine, their chekes muſt conſeſſe their incredulous folly, yf any chriſtian bloud be left, when they shall know, that it is recorded by the holy Ghoſt in ſacred ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <note place="margin">Ind. cap. 13. and cap. 15. Ioſue cap. 10. v. 12.</note> The like affections will they shewe, and the ſame liberty of ſpeech will they vſe, to heare, that at the commandement of an holy man, the ſunne did stoppe his courſe and for ſome time ſtoode ſtill: that the iron heade of an hatchet, was made by an other, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende of it ſelfe from the bottome of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">4.

            <p>Yf then ſuch miracles as theſe, find credit at the Proteſtants handes: why shoulde they contemne thoſe here mentioned, being in them ſelues no more ſtrange or improbable: eſpecially our Sauiour him ſelfe hauing made this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to his Church. <hi>Amen Amen I ſay to</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:21746:17"/> is not commendable, bnt an argument of ignorance or great leuity: ſo to be ſo ſtraight la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as not to credit that, which is published by them that be of knowne antiquity, learning, and vertue, and haue beſides vſed all thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which mans witt can deuiſe, is paſsing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to Godes Saints, openeth the gate to the vtter deniall of all monuments of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all stories of former times whatſoeuer, and is in very truth (not to ſay more) a plaine demonstration, at least of a cauilling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
            <p>For more light of that which hath bene ſaide, let vs a litle deſcende to ſomewhat in particular. <hi>S. Gregory</hi> in this thrid booke, <note place="margin">Cap. 15.</note> telleth how an holy monke called <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> liued a ſolirary life, whoſe cell vpon a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, was enuironed with a huge number of ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which yet God at the praiers of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, destroied with a tempeſt, and afterward by his diuine prouidence, cauſed to be caried away by a great multitude of birds. The story by ſome, may be thought ridiculous, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incredible, and perchance, not many in all his booke more improbable: yet no reaſon, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſtily to cenſure ſo worthy a man, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter was, to ſeede our owne foolish fancy: more zealous of Gods glory I thinke we be not, then he was, nor more sharpe of iudgement, to
<pb facs="tcp:21746:18"/> diſcerne betwixt truth and falshoode, nor yet more religious to auoide fabulous relations: why then should we be ſo captious, or curious as to doubt of that, whereof he made no ſcruple at all? Doth he not alſo note, by what meanes he came to the knowledge thereof, which was not by any vncertayne rumor; or flying tale, but from the mouth (as him ſelfe ſaith) of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and faithfull Priest called <hi>Sanctuſus,</hi> who dwelt in the ſame prouince of <hi>Valeria,</hi> where <hi>Florentius</hi> alſo led his life, and where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaide miracle happened. By all which who ſeeth not, that none can, with any colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, quarrell at the truth of his narration. And, that Gods pleaſure vouch ſaſeth ſometymes, in ſuch ſmall thinges as theſe, to shew his power, for the honour of his ſeruants, we learne out of holy ſcripture. For not only a ſmall pece of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, as in this our caſe, nor an whole towne or prouince, but almost all the country of <hi>Egipt</hi> was pestered with fragges, and the face of the earth ſo couered with locuſts, that they did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and ſpoile all herbes, and fruits of trees: which yet at the interceſsion of <hi>Moiſes,</hi> were<note place="margin">Exod. cap. 8. and cap. 10.</note> all by a weſterne winde caſt into the ſea, ſo that not one remayned in all that lande.</p>
            <p>And not only in Gods word, but alſo in our owne chronicles, and that yet fresh in memory, we reade of as prodigious a thinge, concerning mice and owles: as that which <hi>S. Gregory</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21746:20"/> telleth of ſnakes and birds. The ſtrange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <note place="margin">Anno Domini 1581.

<pb facs="tcp:21746:21"/> what wee like, and reiect what wee pleaſe. This indeede may be the humor, of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant conceipt: but neuer can be the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, of a ſober and staide iudgement.</p>
            <p>But what do I diſpute in a matter ſo clere, as though the authority of one only <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> were not of more waight, to diſcharge him from falshoode, then the empty wordes of thouſandes, that nowe liue to impeach him of that crime. Yet let vs graunt a thinge not to be graunted: to witt, that there be diuers falſe thinges reported in his booke, which is vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: that the moſt of his stories be not true, which is incredible: nay that they be all falſe and fables, which is monstrous and intollerable: yet this being admitted, of neceſsity for all that, graunted it muſt be, that all thoſe points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before mentioned, as praier to Saints: praier for the deade: viſitation of relickes: and the reſt, were then belieued, and practiſed throughout the worlde: for otherwiſe, how coulde he haue ſpoken of them ſo familiarly, yf no ſuch thinges had then bene in vſe, which is ſufficient to proue the antiquity of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that it was the currant doctrine of the primatiue Church, which is the principall and maine pointe, that I intended now to proue.</p>
            <p>VVhat hath beue ſaide, I hope may yelde

Yet for a more clere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of our ſaith, and to shew, that what religion <hi>S.

Auguſtine,</hi> who liued two hundred yeares before the other: the contents whereof shall declare, that the faith of his dayes, was in theſe very points, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants condemne for most abhominable, the very ſelfe ſame which <hi>S. Gregory</hi> taught, and we now proſeſſe and mainetayne: and that ſo plainly, and perſpicuouſly, as none shall deny it, that haue ſo much conſcience, that their tongue can truly report what their harts do thinke: ſo that no doubt can be made, but that it was our religion which the Apostles planted in the world: and conſequently, that which hath from them deſcended vnto vs, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſsion of Paſtors and Doctors, as we can plentifully shew out of diuers histories, and the notable monuments of approued anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Much more concerning this matter might be ſaide, but a Preface giueth not ſcope
<pb facs="tcp:21746:20"/> to large diſcourſes: hereafter Gods grace aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting me, I intende more plentifully and exactly to intreate of this ſubiect.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I cannot but lightely touch one pointe which in reading, may ſomwhat trouble ſuch as be not of learning, nor beaten in matters of controuerſie. And it is concerning <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 14. pag. 385.</note> one <hi>Seruulus</hi> registred in this booke for a Saincte, who albeit he knewe neuer a letter in the booke, yet did he cauſe the worde of God to be readd vnto him, and did much profit therein: which fact of his, may ſeme to ſome to controull the custome of the Catholicke churche, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liketh, nor alloweth, the promiſcuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſcriptures by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vulgar people. But the endes of this difficultie are ſo open, that the knot is ſoone looſed. For the Church neuer forbad the ſcripture in the three learned ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, of the Latin, Greke, &amp; Hebrewe: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Latin being the vulgar language in <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Seruulus</hi> liued, (thoughe ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what decayed by the mixture of forraine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation) lawfully might he doe that, which by no lawe was then forbidden. But ſuppoſe it had bene a vulgar tranſlation, yet certaine it is, that the text was ſyncere, and not fashioned by certaine vpſtart teachers to fitt that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which moſt pleaſed the ytching eares of
<pb facs="tcp:21746:21"/> their newe diſciples nor inuenimed with the deadly drugges, of hereticall inuention, as the tranſlations of our aduerſaries engliſh Bibles be (not to ſpeake of any other) as any that pleaſe, may ſone finde in the <hi>Rhemes</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the latter edition, ſtraight after the Preface, in a ſpeciall rable made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <note place="margin">Printed at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerp. 1600.

God forbidde.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this I do not finde, that in thoſe daies there was any ſuch prohibition enacted againſt vulgar tranſlations: no ſuch neceſsitie then occurring, which might moue the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, to make any ſuch lawe, men in thoſe tymes generally proceedinge, with more diſcretion and moderation. But the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſnes of latter times hath herein bene ſo exorbitant, that requiſite it was, the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te headines of mens vnbridled affections, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de be restrained, and curbed by the ſeueritie of lawe. So in old tyme, not only faſting, but alſo watching in the Church vpon the Eues of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall feaſtes, was with greate deuotion obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and <hi>Vigilantius</hi> the hereticke, about <note place="margin">Contra Vigilant.</note> that very pointe, taxed by the famous doctor <hi>S. Hieron:</hi> yet the greate abuſes, which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tymes brought forth, cauſed that cuſtome to be quite abandoned: for God hath left that
<pb facs="tcp:21746:23"/> authoritye with his Church, in ſuch matters as theſe, to commande or ſorbidde, as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of tymes and edification of mens ſoules shoulde require.</p>
            <p>Lastly, neuer did the Church ſo forbidde vulgar tranſlations, that they might no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies in priuate be readde of lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for euene in theſe our daies, they be founde generally in all languages tranſlated by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, and may be redde of thoſe, that haue licence, which is eaſily graunted to ſuch, as are knowne to be of ſtaide iudgement, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and likely to reade them with ſpirituall profitt to theire ſoules, yea in thoſe countries, which be not infested with the late doctrine of Protestants: marry where that infection ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, the reaſon of reading is more apparant, and conſequently the libertie more inlarged. This being ſo, the fact of <hi>Seruulus</hi> giueth no shelter of refuge to the vnruly practiſe of our tymes, both becauſe the ſcripture readde to him, was in the latin tongue, which neuer any lawe interdicted: and thoughe it had bene in an other vulgar language yet was it not tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the leuin of hereticall noueltie, against which kinde of Bibles in thoſe daies, I ſuppoſe no prohibiting decree can be produced and though there coulde, yet not ſo ſtrict, but that deuoute people and of an humble ſpirit.
<pb facs="tcp:21746:24"/> might haue them with licence, eſpecially ſuch a one as <hi>Scruulus</hi> was, who as <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> reporteth, vſed therein the helpe of religious people. VVere men in theſe daies endoued with his ſpirit, and the ſcriptures ſincerely tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this question woulde be ſone determined. But alas we are fallen into theſe tymes, in which newe maſters with extreme boldnes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue corrupted both the ſacred text it ſelfe, and the vnlearned of either ſex be mounted to ſo highe a pitch of preſumption, and ſo addicted to the ſuggestion of the priuate ſpirit, that they neuer blushe to cenſure &amp; cotrary both fathers &amp; Councels: by reaſon whereof, newe faithes be <note place="margin">Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes burnt. in Smith. field. in the 17. yeare of Queene E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Beinge thus vnreaſonably beaten, without giuinge any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, he went quietly to bed. The next daye, he was to go forth about buſines of the Abbey, &amp; therfor whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mattins were ended, he came to his Abbotes beds ſide, and humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him leaue.

Then the Abbot conſiderin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge from the bottom of his harte, his owne auſteritye and hard dealinge:

And by this means, the Abbot was brought to great meekenes: and the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſcoller, becam a teacher to the maſter. Going afterwarde abroade about the foreſaide buſines of the Abbey, many gentlemen of his acquaintance that had him in greate reuerence much maruailed, and diligently enquired, by what means he cam by ſuch a ſwolne and blacke face, to whom he anſwered: Yeſterday quoth he at eueninge for punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of my ſinns I mett with a foote ſtole, and gat this blowe, which ye ſee: And thus the holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſeruinge both truthe in his ſoule

But the poore man whom exceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue griefe enforced, wolde not giue ouer his petition, but ſwore that he wolde neuer departe, excepte he did raiſe vp his ſonne.

And not hauinge nowe any thinge more lefte, a certaine widowe came vnto him, lamentinge howe her ſonne was taken priſonner by one that was ſonne in lawe to the kinge of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and by him carried away to be his ſlaue: and therfore she beſough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te him, that he wolde vouchſafe to helpe her with a ranſome for the redeeming of her ſonne: But the man of God ſeeking what he had to giue the poore woman, founde nothinge left but him ſelfe alone, and therfore he anſwered her in this manner. Good woman nothing haue I to helpe the

Euery day <hi>Paulinus</hi> brought him to his table diuers ſortes of grene her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, and after dinner returned to his gardin. After he had vſed this a longe

It is verie true that which you haue hearde, for the laſt nighte in a dreame, I ſawe certaine

                           <p>AT ſuche tyme as the Gothes firſt inuaded Italye, there was nere to the citye of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> a vertuous and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man called <hi>Iſaac:</hi> who liued almoſt to the laſt daies of the Gothes, whom many did knowe, and eſpecially the holy virgin <hi>Gregoria,</hi> which nowe dwelleth in this citye, hard by the churche of the bleſſed and perpetuall virgin <hi>Marie:</hi> which woman in her yonger yeares, deſiring to liue a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes life, fled to the churche from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riag, already agreed vpon by her frein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and was by this man defended: and ſo through Gods prouidence, obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Nunnes ware a peculiar habit, and liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married.</note> to haue that habitt, which ſo much she deſired, and ſo leauing her ſpouſe vpon earth, she merited a ſpouſe in heauen. Many thinges alſo I had by the relation of the reuerent man <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who was familiarly acquainted with him: and his vertuous life doth giue credit to his wordes. This holy
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:21746:146"/> man <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not borne in <hi>Italye;</hi> and therfore I wil only ſpeake of ſuche mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as he did liuinge here in our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untrye. At his firſt comminge out of <hi>Syria</hi> to the city of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> he went to the churche, and deſired the keepers, that he mighte haue free leaue to praye there, and not to be enforced to depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te when nighte came. And ſo he began his deuotions, and ſpent all that daye in praier, and likewiſe the nighte followinge. The ſeconde daye and nighte he beſtowed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and remayned there alſo the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de daye: which when one of the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the church perceiued, who was a man of a proud ſpirit, he tooke ſcandall by that, whereof he ought to haue reaped great profitt. For he began to ſay that he was an hyppocrite and couſining companion, who in the ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the worlde remayned at his praiers three dayes and three nightes together: &amp; forth with running vpon the man of God, he ſtrook him, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke him by that meanes with shame to departe the churche as an hyppocryte, and one that deſired to be reputed an holy man. But to reuenge this iniurye,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21746:146"/> a wicked ſpirit did preſently poſſeſſe his body, who caſt him downe at the feete of the man of God, and began by his mouth to crye out: <hi>Iſaac</hi> doth caſt me forth, <hi>Iſaac</hi> doth caſt me forth. For what name the ſtraunge man had, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne at that tyme did knowe, but the wicked ſpirit told it, when he cried out that he had power to caſt him out. Straighte-waies the man of God, lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de him ſelfe vpon his bodye, and the curſed deuill that was entred in, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all haſt: newes of this was by and by blowne ouer the whole city, and men and wemen, riche and poore came runnynge, euery one ſtriuinge to bringe him home to theire owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe: Some for the buildinge of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, did humbly offer him landes, other money, and ſome ſuch other helpes as they coulde. But the ſeruaunt of almighty God, refuſyng to accept any of theire offers, departed out of the citye, and not farr of, he founde a deſert place, where he builte a little cotage for him ſelfe: To whom many repayringe, began by his example to be inflamed with the loue of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinge life, and ſo vnder his diſcipline,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21746:147"/> and gouernment, gaue them ſelues to the ſeruice of almighty God. And when his diſciples wolde often hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inſinuate, that it were goode for the neceſsity of the Abbey, to take ſuch liuinges as were offred, he very carefull to keepe pouertye, tolde them conſtantly, ſayinge. A monke that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for liuinges vpon earthe is no monke: for ſo fearefull he was to looſe the ſecure ſtate of his pouertye, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous riche men are carefull, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theire corruptible wealthe.</p>
                           <p>In that place therfore he became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the ſpirit of prophecye: and his life was renoumed far and nere, for the notable miracles which he wrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte. For vpon a day, towardes eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, he cauſed his monkes to lay a certaine number of ſpades in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. The nighte followinge, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge <note place="margin">Mattens.</note> to cuſtome they roſe vp to theire praiers, he commanded them, ſayinge. Go your waies, and make po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for our worckemen, that it may be readye very earely in the mornin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge. And when it was day, he bad them bringe the potage which they had prouided: and goinge with his monkes
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21746:147"/> into the gardin, he founde there ſo many men workinge, as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to lay ſpades: for it fell ſo out, that certaine thieues were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in to ſpoile and robb it: but God chaunginge theire mindes, they tooke the ſpades which they founde there, and ſo wrought from the tyme of theire firſt entrance, vntil the man of God came vnto them: and all ſuch partes of the grounde as before were not manured, they had digged vpp and made readie. When the man of God was com, he ſaluted them in this wiſe. God ſaue you goode brethren: you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue laboured longe, wherfore now reſt your ſelues: then he cauſed ſuch proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as he had broughte, to be ſett be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, &amp; ſo after theire labour and paines refreshed them. When they had eaten that was ſufficient, he ſpake thus vnto them. Doe not hereafter any more harme: but when you deſire any thinge that is in the gardin, come to the gate, quietlye aske it, and take it a Gods bleſsinge, but ſteale no more: and ſo beſtowing vpon them good ſtore of wortes, he ſent them awaye. And by this meanes it fell out that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21746:148"/> they which came into the gardin to doe harme, departed thence not doing any damage at all, and beſides had the rewarde of theire paines, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alſo of charitye beſtowed vpon them.</p>
                           <p>At an other tyme, there came vnto him certaine ſtraunge men a begginge, ſo torne and tattred, that they had ſcant any ragges to couer them, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeechinge him to helpe them with ſome cloathes. The man of God hearinge theire demande gaue them no anſwere: but ſecretly callinge for one of his monkes, bad him goe into ſuche a woode, and in ſuch a place of the woode to ſeeke for an hollow tree, and to bringe vnto him that apparrel which he founde there. The monke went his way and broughte cloſely to his maſter that which he had founde. Then the man of God called for thoſe poore naked men, and gaue them that apparrell, ſaying: Put on theſe cloathes to couer your naked bodies withall. They ſeeing theire owne garmentes, were wonderfully confounded: for thincking by cunning to haue gotten other mens apparrell, with shame
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:21746:148"/> they receiued only theire owne.</p>
                           <p>Againe at another tyme, one there was, that commended him ſelfe to his prayers, and ſent him by his ſeruaunt two basketes full of meate: one of the which as he was in his iornye, he too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke away, and hidd in a bushe till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe: and the other he preſented to the man of God, telling him how his maſter had ſent him that, hartily commendinge him ſelfe to his praiers. The holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tooke that which was ſent verie kindelye, giuing the meſſenger this goode leſſon: I pray the my freinde to thancke they maſter, and take heede howe thowe doeſt lay han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vpon the basket, for a ſnake is crept in, &amp; therfore be carefull, leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it doth ſtinge the. At theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the meſſenger was pitifullye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and though glad he was that by this means he eſcaped death, yet ſome what grieued that he was put to that shame.

                           <p>Gods prouidence <hi>Peter</hi> in beſtowin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of his giftes is wonderful: for often it falleth out, that vpon whom he vouchſafeth the greater, he giueth not the leſſe: to the end that alwaies they may haue ſomewhat to miſlike in them ſelues: ſo that deſiringe to arriue vnto perfection, and yet can not: and labour inge about that which they haue not obtayned, and can not preuaile: by this

And this was the cauſe, that when God had brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te his people into the lande of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and deſtroied all theire mightye &amp; potent enemies, yet did he longe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me after reſerue the <hi>Philiſteans</hi> and <hi>Chananites,</hi> that as it is written, <hi>he mighte</hi>

His firſt miracle was, that ſo ſone as he made choiſe of that caue for his habitation: there ſprunge water out of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe rocke, which was neither more nor leſſe, then ſerued for his neceſsity: By which almighty God, did shewe what great care he had of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, ſeeinge miraculouſly as in aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tyme he had before done to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he cauſed the harde rocke to yelde forth water.

                           <p>Ouer his caue there was a great rocke, which ſeemed to hange but by a little pece vnto the mountaine, and therfore dailye was it feared that it wolde fall, and ſo kill the ſeruaunt of God.

                           <p>At ſuch tyme as this holy man, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me firſt to inhabit that mountaine, and had not yet made any dore for his

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21746:161"/> other he is broughte from death, which shall liue for euer. For I will name you two, and tell me, in which of them as you thincke the greater miracle was wroughte. The firſt is <hi>Lazarꝰ</hi> a true beleeuer, whom our Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de raiſed vp in fleshe: the other is <hi>Saul,</hi> whom our Lorde raiſed in ſoule. For of <hi>Lazarus</hi> vertues after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we reade nothinge: but after the raiſinge vp of the others ſoule, we are not able to conceiue, what wonderful thinges be in holy ſcripture ſpoken of his vertues: as that his moſt cruell thoughtes and deſignements were turned to the bowels of piety and compaſſion: that he deſired to dy for his brethen, in whoſe death before he tooke muche pleaſure: That knowin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the holy ſcriptures perfectly, yet profeſſed that he knew nothinge els but <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and him crucified. That he did willingly endure the bearing of roddes for Chriſt: whom before with ſworde he did perſecute. That he was exalted to the dignitye of an Apoſtle: &amp; yet willingly became a little one in the middeſt of other diſciples. That he was rapte to the ſecretes of the thirde
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21746:162"/> heauen, and yet did turne his eye of compaſsion to diſpoſe of the dutye of married folkes, ſayinge: <hi>Let the husband</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Corint.</note> 
                              <hi>render debt to the wife, and the wife likewiſe to the husbande.</hi> That he was buſied in contemplatinge the quires of Angels: and yet contemned not to thincke, and diſpoſe of the factes of carnall men. That he reioyſed in his infirmities: and tooke pleaſure in his reproaches. That for him to liue is Chriſt, and gaine to dye. That althoughe he liued in fleshe, yet was he wholy out of the fleshe. Beholde howe this bleſſed Apoſtle li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, who from hell returned in his ſoule to the life of vertue: wherfore leſſe it is for one to be raiſed vp in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, excepte perchance by the reuiuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge thereof, he be alſo broughte to the life of his ſoule, and that the outward miracle do ſerue for the giuing of life to the inwarde ſpirit.</p>

In that mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery they had an Abbot of holy life, who broughte vp a certaine monke that became very vertuous, whom he
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21746:169"/> perceiuinge to increaſe in the feare of God, he cauſed him in the ſame mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie to be made Prieſte: who after his taking of orders, vnderſtoode by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that his deathe was not far of: and therfore deſired leaue of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, to make readye his ſepulchre, who tolde him, that him ſelfe sholde dy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: but yet for all that (quoth he) go your waye, and make your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue at your pleaſure. Away he went, and did ſo. Not many daies after, the olde Abbot fell ſicke of an age we, and drawinge nere to his ende, he bad the foreſaide Prieſt that ſtoode by him, to bury his body in that graue, which he had made for him ſelfe: and when the other tolde him, that he was shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie to followe after, and that the graue was not bygge ynoughe for bothe: the Abbot anſwered him in this wiſe, do as I haue ſaide, for that one graue shall contayne bothe our bodies. So he died, and accordinge to his deſire, was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in that graue which the Prieſt had prouided for him ſelfe. Sraighte after, the Prieſt fell ſicke, and lay not longe before he departed this life: and when his body was by the monkes broughte
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21746:169"/> to the graue, which he had prouided for him ſelfe, they opened it, and ſawe that there was not any rome, becauſe the Abbots corps filled the whole place: then one of them with a loude voice, ſaide: O father where is your promiſe, that this graue sholde holde you bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the?

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21746:179"/> anſwered, that he wolde neuer forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the true faithe, which he had once imbraced, his father in great a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke awaye his kingdom, and beſide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued him of all wealth and riches: and perceiuinge, that with all this, his minde was nothinge moued, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to ſtraight priſon, laying irons both vpon his necke and handes.

                           <p>When the ſolemne feaſt of Eaſter <note place="margin">The feaſt of Eaſter.</note> was come, his wicked father ſent vnto him in the deade of the nighte an Arrian Bishop, to giue him the communion of a ſacrilegious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, that he mighte the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby againe recouer his fathers
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21746:180"/> grace and fauour: but the man of God as he oughte, sharpely reprehended that Arrian Bishop which came vnto him, and giuing him ſuch entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as his deſertes required, vtterly reiected him: for albeit outwardly he laye there in bandes, yet inwardly to him ſelfe he ſtoode ſecure in the height of his owne ſoule. The father at the returne of the Arrian prelat vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge theſe newes, fell into ſuch a rage, that forthwith he ſent his officers of execution to putt to death that moſt conſtant confeſſor, in the verye priſon where he lay: which vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and blody commandement was performed accordingly: for ſo ſone as they came into the priſon, they claue his braynes with an hatchet, and ſo bereaued him of mortall life, hauinge only power to take that from him which the holy martir made ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. Afterwarde for the publiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge of his true glorye to the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, there wanted not miracles from heauen: for in the nighte tyme ſinginge was hearde at his bodye: ſome alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, that in the nighte, burninge lampes, were ſene in that place: by

To whom the ſicke man anſwered, that his tyme was at hande, ſaying that there came vnto him a yonge man with letters, willing him to open and reade them: which when he had done, he ſaide that he founde both his owne name, and all the reſt of them which the Eaſter before had bene baptized by that Biſhop, written in letters of gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: and firſt of all he ſaide that he foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de his owne name, and afterwarde the reſt of them that were chriſtned at that tyme: by which he made no doubt but that both him ſelfe and the reſt, ſhoulde ſhortly depart this life, and ſo it fell out, for he died that very daye:
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:21746:235"/> and after him followed all thoſe which had before benebaptiſed, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of a fewe daies, no one of them was left aliue.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccordinge to promiſe (gentle Reader) I haue here for the antiquitie and veritie of our religion, added to S.</hi> Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>the teſtimonie of glorious S.</hi> Auſten: <hi>vpon whom the heauenly dewe of Gods grace was ſo plentifully powred, that he was for sharpeneſſe of witt, depth of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, and holynes of life, both to them of his time, and all poſteritie, the light of the world, and ſalt of the earth. Many, ſingular, and rare testimonies for his vertue, learninge, and zeale of true religion, might be produced: but I will content my ſelfe only with two. The first shalbe of S.</hi> Celeſtinus <hi>Bishoppe of</hi> Rome <hi>who writeth thus in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation:</hi> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinum <note place="margin">Epiſt. 1. ad quoſda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Galliaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Epiſcopos. cap. 2.</note> ſanctae recordationis viru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.

At the begininge he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored the opinion of them, which be called Maniches: but by the continuall prayer of his goode mother Monica, and the perſuaſion of holy S. Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, he was conuerted to the true faith. They both being repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, ſang the pſalme <hi>Te Deum,</hi> anſwering mutually one the other.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21746:288"/> After in prayer, writinge, &amp; preachin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, he ſo much profited the Church, that his name is worthyly had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of all men: <hi>and generally all Protestants ſo esteeme him, as of no one Doctor more. To this holy and learned Father, we appeale for tryall of our cauſe. They denye prayer and inuocation of Saintes, as iniurious to Christ, and ſauoringe of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrye: we defend it as Catholicke, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall. They condemne pilgrimage and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitinge of Martyrs tombes for ſuperſtitious, and abhominable: VVe teach it to be goode and lawfull. They detest shrininge of Saintes bones, the reuerent touchinge and carrying their relicks in proceſsion: VVe imbrace it as highly redoundinge to the honour of God, from whoſe diuine fountayne all their grace did flow, and by ſuch ſignes do praiſe God in his Saints, and know their death to be precious in his ſight. Now whether in theſe pointes S.</hi> Auſten <hi>doth fauor vs, or helpe them, that I leaue to the iudgment of all Protestants, thoughe neuer ſo partiall in their owne cauſe, aſter they haue readd ouer this smal treatiſe; for our cauſe is ſo clere, and the auncient father ſo cloſe on our ſide, that most aſſured I am, were his name ſuppreſsed, and a title prefixed accordingly (which ſpirituall ſtratagem with ſuch as allowe</hi>

And what man of common ſenſe, that readeth his owne woordes, will euer thinke that he could retract what he there writeth, concerning prayer to Saints, viſitation of relicks and the like? ſeinge they were not any priuate opinions of his owne, but the common beleefe and practiſe of Gods Church, as is euident out of the treatiſe followinge. Smaller matters God knoweth they be, which he ſpeaketh oſ in his Retractations, and two only things he retracteth in his booke of the</hi> City of God <hi>from whence theſe ſtories are taken.

                  <p>The ſame man had alſo giuen him by a friend of his a peece of holy earth, brough from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> out of our Sauiours ſepulchre, which he had hanged vp in his owne chamber, leaſt ſome harme migh alſo haue come to himſelfe. But after his houſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the foreſayd trouble, he begane to thinke with himſelfe, what was beſt to be done with that earth, which now for reuerence ſake, he would not any longer kepe in his chamber. It ſell ſo out, that my ſelfe and <hi>Maximinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sinicen</hi> were not far of, whome he requeſted to come thither, which we willingly did.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21746:293"/> And after he had told vs all that which had happened, he deſired that the holy earth might be put in ſome place, and ſo to haue a Chappell built, vnto which Chriſtians might re paire, for the celebratinge of ſuch things as belonge to God. Content we were to ſatisfie his deſire, and ſo it was done accordingly. There dwelt not far of a certaine younge man of the country, ſicke of the palſye, who hearinge hereof, deſired his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that without all delay they would carry him to that place, which being done, there he prayed, and forth with departed from thence ſafe and ſound.</p>
                  <p>In a certaine village called <hi>Victoria,</hi> not thirtye miles diſtant from <hi>Kings Hippo,</hi> there is a ſhrine of the bleſſed martirs of <hi>Millan, Geruaſius</hi> and <hi>Protaſius,</hi> vnto which a certaine young man was brought, into whome the deuill had entered, as he was a waſhing of his horſe in the heates of ſummer. Lying there almoſt dead, or at leaſt like a dead man, the Lady of the place according to the cuſtome, came thither with her maides, and certaine Nunnes, to euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong, &amp; they began to ſinge hymnes:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21746:293"/> with which noiſe he was as it wer ſtrooken and ſhaken out, and roaring terribly, he layd hould of the altar, and not daring, or not being able, to ſtirr it, yet let it go he would not, but held it as faſt as though he had bene bound or nayled to the ſame, and pittyfully howling out, he deſired them to ſpare him, confeſsing where, when, and in what manner, he poſſeſſed the young man. At length he told them that he would go forth, and named all thoſe parts of his body, which he threatned at his departure to cutt of: and whils he was thus ſpeakinge, out he went. But the mans eye fell out vppon his cheeke, and hunge there by a litle ſtring, cominge as it were from the inward roote, and the midſt of his eye which before was black, became all white: which thing when the people preſent did behould, (for many that heard him cry out ſo terriblie came thither, all which proſtrate prayed for him) though glad they were to ſee him ſound of mind:, yet ſory for the hurt of his eye, and thought it the beſt way to ſend for a ſurgeon: but his brother in law who had brought him thither,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21746:294"/> liked not, of that, for God is able (quoth he) by the prayers of his Saints who hath caſt out the deuill, to reſtore him likewiſe his eye againe. Wherfore as well as he could, he put the eye into his former place, and bound it cloſe vpp, not thinking goode to haue it opened vntill ſeauen dayes were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, after which time he found it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly weell.</p>
                  <p>Others alſo in the ſame place were cured, of all which to ſpeake in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer would be tedious and ouer long. A certayne old man there was called <hi>Florentius</hi> dwellinge here in <hi>Hippo.</hi> one that was religious and poore, and gott his liuinge by mendinge of garments, who by ill chance loſt his cloake, not hauinge wherewith to buy an other: where-vppon he went to Church and prayed to the twenty martyrs (whoſe ſhrine at this day is here very famous) that they would helpe him to an other cloake: and he ſpake ſo loude that certayne mery companions that ouer heard him, fell a laughinge; ieſtinge, &amp; ſcoffinge at him, as though he had begged mony of the martyrs to buy him a new garment, and in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21746:294"/> this manner they followed him out of the Church. But the good man without ſaying any thing, went forth: where he eſpied vppon the ſea ſide, a great fiſh leaping and skippinge, that was lately caſt vp, which by their help he gott, and ſtrayght after ſould it to a certayne cooke called <hi>Carcoſo,</hi> for an hundred halfepence, (which cooke was an honeſt man, and a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) telling him all the matter as it had happened, purpoſing with the mony to buy ſome wool, that his wife therof might prouide him more appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. But when the cooke came to open the fiſh, he found in the bowels a ringe of gould: whervppon moued by and by with pitty, &amp; terrified with religion, he reſtored it to <hi>Florentius,</hi> ſaying: behould how liberally the twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty marty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At the <hi>Tibilitan</hi> waters, at ſuch time as Biſhopp <hi>Proiectus</hi> carried thither the relickes of the moſt glorious martyr S. <hi>Steuen</hi> great multitudes of people came to his ſhrine, amongſt whom a blinde woman, deſired that ſhe might be brought to the Biſhoppe, that carried thoſe holy relickes:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21746:295"/> and when ſhe was come, ſhe gaue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine flowers, which ſhe brought: and receiuinge them agayne, ſhe put them to her eyes, and ſtrayght wayes ſhe was reſtored to her former ſight.</p>

                     <hi>Eucharius</hi> a Spaniſh Prieſt dwelling at <hi>Calama,</hi> lay ſicke of an old diſeaſe of the ſtone, and was cured by the ſhrine of the foreſayd martyr S. <hi>Sreuen,</hi> which Biſhopp <hi>Poſsidius</hi> brought to that place. The very ſame man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the extremity of an other ſicknes, lay ſo like a dead man, that none makinge any doubt therof, they bound his hands together: but by help of the foreſayd martyr, one bringing the preiſts coate from his ſhrine, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21746:295"/> caſting it vppon his body, he was reſtored to life againe.</p>
                  <p>There dwelt in the ſame place, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his degree, in very good accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, called <hi>Martialis,</hi> vvel ſtrooken in yeares, but one that could not abide Chriſtian religion: yet his daughter and ſonne in lawe were both Chriſtians, baptiſed that very yeare: both Chriſtians, baptiſed that very yeare: both which inſtantly beſought their ſicke father, that he would likewiſe become a Chriſtian: but all in vayne, for in no wiſe could they perſwade him, but in great anger he commanded them out of his ſight. His ſonne in lawe in that neceſsity, thought it beſt to viſitte the ſhrine of S. <hi>Steuen,</hi> and there with all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to make his prayers, that God would giue him a good minde, and inſpire him quickly to become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and to beleeue in Chriſt: and ſo he did with great ſighing, many teares, much ſinceritye, and a burninge affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of true pietie: and vppon his de parture, he carried with him from the altar, ſome of the flowers which came next to hand, and when it was night, he layd them vnder his father in lawes head, after which he fell a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21746:296"/> ſleepe: and behold before it was yet morning, the old man cried out, that thy would runne to the Biſhop (who by chance was then with me at <hi>Hippo)</hi> but vnderſtandinge that he was not at home, he deſired that ſome of his Prieſts would vouchſafe to come vnto him: and when they were preſent, he told them that he did now beleeue in Chriſt, and ſo he was baptiſed, to their great admiration and ioy. And ſo long as he liued after, he had theſe words continually in his mouth: O Chriſt receiue my ſpirite: him ſelfe being altogether ignorant, that theſe were the very laſt words which S. <hi>Steuene</hi> ſpake, when he was ſtoned of the Iewes: which were alſo the laſt that euer he vttered, for not long after he departed this life.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place three others ſicke of the goute, wer cured by the ſame martyr. Two of them were Cityzens, and the third a Pilgrim: and the City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were ſtraight healed with out any more adoe: but the Pilgrim was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by reuelation what he ſhould do, when the payne came vppon him,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21746:296"/> which ſo often as he did the griefe ſtraight vaniſhed away.</p>
                  <p>There is a peece of ground called <hi>Andurus,</hi> where there is a Chnrch, and in it a ſhrine of the martyr S. <hi>Steuen.</hi> By chance certayne oxen running out of the vvay, did vvith the vvheele of the cart, cruſh a litle childe as he vvas playing in the yard, and by and by, after a fevv pangues it gaue vp the ghoſt. The mother tooke it vp in her armes, and carried it to the Church, &amp; there layd it before the ſhrine of the martyr: and it did not only returne to life, but vvas alſo perfectly cured, that no ſhew of any hurt at all remayned.</p>
                  <p>A certayne Nunne likewiſe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge hard by the ſame Church, in a place called <hi>Caſpaliana,</hi> was deſperatly ſicke, whoſe gowne ſome of her friends carried to the ſame ſhrine, and before it vvas brought backe agayne, ſhe vvas dead: notvvith ſtandinge at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, they layed it vppon her dead corpes, vvhervpon her ſoule returned into her body, and ſhe to life agayne.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Hippo,</hi> one <hi>Baſſus</hi> borne in <hi>Siria,</hi> did pray before the ſhrine of the ſame martyr for his daughter, vvhich vvas

His ſeruants in haſt came from his houſe, to let him vnderſtand that dolefull newes: but his freinds that mett them, did vtterly forbidd them, leaſt he ſhould before the people haue lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably cryed out. Returning home, and finding the houſe full of weeping and wayling, he layd vpon her dead corps, the garment which he brought from the ſhrine of the martyr: and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe returned to life againe.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place the ſonne of one <hi>Ireneus</hi> a collector, departed this life: whoſe body likewiſe was layd forth, and all things with much weepinge &amp; ſorrow made ready for his buryall.

                  <p>Likewiſe <hi>Eleuſinus</hi> the Tribune, who dwelleth here amongſt vs, had a young ſonne of his, an infant, which dyed: whome he layd vpon the ſhrine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21746:297"/> of the Martyr which is in the ſubvr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, and after he had prayed there with teares, he carryed him backe aliue.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I doe? my promiſe to finiſh this worke doth binde me, that I can not here report all thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which I knowe: and no queſtion but many Chriſtians will be ſory (when they reade theſe here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) for that I haue paſſed ouer ſo many other with ſilence, which they know no leſſe then my ſelfe: whome at this time I beſeech to pardon me, and to thinke with them ſelues, what a labour it is to performe that, which the neceſsity of the worke taken in hand compelleth me not to performe. For if I ſhould write only of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous cures (to omitt all other) which haue bene wrought by this glorious martyr <hi>Steuen</hi> in the Colony of <hi>Chala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> as alſo in oures, it would require many bookes: and yet all could not be gathered together, but only thoſe, of which certificates haue bene giuen, to the end they might be read to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for we tooke order to haue it ſo done, for as much as miracles alſo in our tymes like vnto thoſe of former
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21746:298"/> dayes haue bene wrought, which vve thinke very conuenient that they ſhould come to the knowledge of many. And it is not two yeares ſince, that this ſhrine began to be at <hi>Kings Hippo,</hi> and many (vvhich vve knovv moſt certaynly) gaue no certificates in vvritinge of ſuch miracles as happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and yet when I wrott this, the number of them vvhich haue bene giuen, came almoſt to ſeauenty. But at <hi>Chalama</hi> vvhere his ſhrine vvas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and vvhere ſuch billes or certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates be oftner deliuered in, they be incomparably far more.</p>
                  <p>We knowe alſo that at <hi>Vzalis,</hi> which is a colony not far from <hi>Vtica,</hi> many notable things haue bene done by the ſame martyr <hi>S.

For at my being there, vvihch vvas not long ſince, both my ſelfe and the Biſhoppe of the ſame place, did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvade the Lady <hi>Petronia</hi> a noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was there miraculouſly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21746:298"/> cured of a great &amp; long diſeaſe (about which many Phiſitians had laboured in vaine) that ſhe would giue vp in writinge a publike teſtimonial of the miracle, that it might be readde to the people, which moſt obediently ſhe performed: wherin alſo ſhe putt downe that, which though I make haſt forward, yet I can not omitt. She ſayd therfore that she was perſwaded by a certayn Iewe, to put a ring on a girdle made of heare, and to tye that about her, next vnto her bare body: and that vnder the gemme of the ring ſhe ſhould put a ſtone, that was found in the reines of an oxe: hauinge tyed this about her, as a remedy for her diſeaſe, forth ſhe went to the ſhrine of the martyr, and departing from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> she lodged all night at her owne mannor, in the confines of the riuer <hi>Bagrada:</hi> and riſing vp in the morning to go forward on her iorney, ſhe eſpied the ring lying vpon the ground before her feete: where at ſome-what ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, she felt vppon the girdle, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that, as it was before, with all the knotts faſt tyed, she ſuſpected that the ringe had bene broken, and ſo ſlipped
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21746:299"/> out: but findinge that alſo ſafe and ſound, then she preſumed that by ſo notable a miracle, she had almoſt a pledg of her future recouery: where vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she looſed that girdle, &amp; together with the ring threw it into the riuer. They will not beleeue this, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <note place="margin">And in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes.</note> not that our Lord <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> was brought forth without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement to his mothers virginity, and that he entred into his diſciples the dores being shutt: but let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the truth of this relation, and yf they finde it to be as I haue reported, then let them beleeue thoſe other things to be moſt true; the woman is honorable, of an honorable parenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and honorably maried. She dwelt in <hi>Carthage,</hi> which is a great city, and she of great nobilitie. Such things as theſe, ſuffer not ſuch a miracle as this to be vnknowne. The martyr himſelfe by whoſe interceſſion she was cured, beleeued in the ſonne of her, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned a virgin: beleeued in him who entred into his diſciples the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res being shutt. Finally, which is the cauſe why I haue made rehear ſale of all theſe things, he beleeued in him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21746:299"/> who in that flesh aſcended vp into heauen, in which he roſe from death, and therfore by him ſo many miracles are wrought, becauſe for his faith he shedd his bloud.</p>
                  <p>One miracle there is, which was done here amonge vs, I ſay not greater then the former recited, but ſo famous and well knovvne, that I thinke there is none dwelling in <hi>Hippo,</hi> but eyther did ſe it, or at leaſt hath heard there of, neyther is it poſsible that any can euer forgett it. Seuen brothers and three ſiſters there were, all children of one man, borne at <hi>Ceſarea</hi> in the countrie of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> of a good family: whom the mother ſtraight vppon the death of their father did curſe, for a certayne iniury which they offered her, and which ſhe tooke paſsing heauylye. Whervpon God puniſhed them with ſuch a pittifull palſye, that they did moſt horribly ſhake: vpon which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable chance, being aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne where they were knowne, they departed for diuers countries, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring vp and downe throuhhout the whole Romaine Empire: and at length two of them, the brother and the

The people preſent ſome were amazed, ſome afrayd, ſome grieued, and one amongſt the reſt being about to lift him vp, others would not ſuffer him, but thought it better to expect, to ſee what would become of him: and behould after he had remayned in that manner ſome litle time, he roſe vp without any ſhaking at all: being now ſafe and ſound, &amp; ſtoode amongſt them in perfect health, behoulding them that marueiled at him. Who was then preſent that looked vppon him, and ſawe what was done, that did not magnifie and prayſe Gods name? And the Church on all ſides did rebound with noyſe, the people cryed ſo out, and reioyſed at that which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: Word of this miracle was brought vnto me, where I was ſitting ready to come into the Church, one poſting after an other, the latter euer bringing that for newes, which others had told before him. As I was glad, and ſecretly in myne heart gaue God thankes, in cometh the man himſelfe with a great troupe following him, whome falling downe at my fecte I embraced and lifted vp againe.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21746:301"/> Forth we came to the people, where we found the Church, ſounding with ioy, each man on all ſides crying out, God be thanked, and his name be bleſſed for euer: I ſaluted the people, and ſorth with out they cried againe, repeating but far more feruently, the ſame very words.

                  <p>The man went home with me to dinner, where very diligently he told me the whole hiſtory of the calamitie of his mother and brethren.

Demaunding therfore what had happened, and what was the cauſe of that ioyfull crying out, they brought her from the ſhrine of the martyr, into the Church where we were: wherevpon there was ſuch a marueilous crying out of men and

Backe agayne was ſhe brought to the ſame place, where a litle before ſhe ſtoode trembling and ſhaking. Reioyſing there was that ſhe was found, like vnto her brother, for whom a litle before ſory they were, that like ſhe was not: and although as yet they had not prayed for her, yet by the ſequell they perceiued, that the deſires of their harts were already heard. Such reioyſing and ſhowtinge out ther was, ſuch lauding &amp; prayſing God, not in words, but with ſuch a wonderfull ioyfull noyſe, that myne eares could ſcarce indure it: what was in the harts of that ioyfull people, but the fayth of Chriſt, for which bleſſed <hi>Steuen</hi> ſhed his bloud.</p>

                     <p>In this neceſsitie the holy man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed into thoſe partes, hauing bene often before intreated by the church of that countrie: and then finallie both perſwaded, and alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted thither, by the moſt reuerend Prelat <hi>Albericus,</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and legate of the Apoſtolike ſea. Vpon his arriuall there, he was receiued with wonderfull ioy by the people of that countrie, as thoughe an Angell had come from heauene.</p>
                     <p>Long he coulde not ſtay amongſt them, becauſe it was not poſsible to hinder the people from preſsing vpon him, ſo mighty a concurſe there was of them that came vnto him day and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21746:306"/> night, crauinge his bleſsing, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſiring his helpe. Yet did he preach for ſome daies in the citie of <hi>Toloſa,</hi> and other places, which that wretche had moſt frequented, &amp; more daungerouſly infected: inſtructing many that were ſimple in faith, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thningthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that did wauer, calling backe thoſe that were gone a ſtraye, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ouerthrowne, preſsing and beating downe with his authoritie, the ſubuerters and obſtinate, in ſuch ſorte, that they were ſo far from reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting him, as they durſt not ſo much as come in his preſence. And albeit, that hereticke at that time fled awaye, and lay cloſe: yet were his waies ſo ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, &amp; all paſſages ſo beſett, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde he coulde ſcarſe remayne any where in ſaftye: at length being taken and bounde, he was deliuered ouer to the Biſhoppe. In that iorny alſo, God was glorified in his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by verie many miracles which he wrought, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling the ſoules of ſome from theire wicked errors, and healing the bodies of others, from diuers diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>There is a place in that countrie called <hi>Sarlatum,</hi> where after he had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21746:306"/> made an end of his ſermon, they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the ſeruant of God (as in all places they vſed to doe) breade to be bleſſed: which he lifting vppe his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and making the ſigne of the croſſe, did bleſſe, ſaying: By this ſhall ye knowe, that the doctrine which I preach is true, and that falſe which hereticks, do tell you, yf thoſe which be ſicke amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt you, eating of of this breade, do recouer their former health. But the venerable Biſhoppe of <hi>Chartiers,</hi> that great <hi>Gaufridus</hi> being preſent, and next vnto the man of God, fearing the euent, adioyned theſe wordes: Yf they receiue it (quoth he) with a goode faith they ſhalbe cured. To whom the holy father, nothing doubting of Gods power, ſpake thus. I ſaide not ſo: but that thoſe which eat thereof, ſhall verilye be cured: to the ende they may thereby knowe vs to be the true and faithfull meſſengers of God. After which, ſo greate a multitude of ſicke perſons that eate of that breade, recouered and became well, that the newes thereof ran through out all that countrie: and the holy man in his returne, ſhunned and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21746:307"/> was affraide to goe vnto fuch places as were there about, by reaſon of the intollerable concurſe of people.</p>

After he had comforted the afflicted man, and giuene him his bleſsinge he departed: and as him ſelfe after war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de confeſſed, the faithfull ſeruant ſpake vnto our Lord in his harte, with greate confidence and faith ſaying: What doſt thow expect ô Lorde God.

One of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpon a ſuddaine meeting with this man, was ſo terrified, that he cried out, verily thinking him to be ſome ghoſt.

But at length, the veritie of the thinge it ſelfe, cauſed both him and others to beleeue it. The brethren vnderſtanding theſe newes, made haſt to be partakers of ſo pleaſaunt a ſighte.
